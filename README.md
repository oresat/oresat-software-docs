# OreSat - Software Intern Onboarding Guide

Welcome to the OreSat Software Internship program! We're excited to have you join our team as we work towards building 
Oregon's own open source CubeSats. This onboarding guide is specifically designed for software interns, providing essential
information about our development environment, tools, and best practices. By following the steps outlined 
in this guide, you'll be set up and ready to contribute to OreSat's success in no time.

## Getting Started

To begin, please follow the steps below:

1. Read the [Git Primer](docs/git-primer.md).
2. Read the [Vagrant Primer](docs/vagrant.md).
3. Review the [HLD](docs/software-hdl.mermaid).

## Contributing 

As a software intern at OreSat, you'll have the opportunity to contribute to various projects and subsystems. 
To ensure a smooth and consistent development process, please adhere to the following best practices:

1. **Communicate**: Keep your mentor and team members informed about your progress. 
Don't hesitate to ask for help or clarification when needed.

2. **Branching**: Always create a new branch for each task or feature you're working on. This keeps the main branch 
clean and makes it easier to manage and review changes.

3. **Commit frequently**: Make small, atomic commits with clear and concise commit messages. This makes it easier to
track changes and identify potential issues.

4. **Code review**: Submit your changes as a pull request for review by your mentor or team members. Address any 
feedback and update your code as necessary.

5. **Testing**: Make sure to test your code thoroughly before submitting it for review. This helps catch any bugs or 
issues early in the development process.

We look forward to working with you and watching you grow as a software developer during your internship at OreSat! 
Your contributions will play a crucial role in advancing Oregon's space exploration efforts and shaping the future of
open source CubeSats.
