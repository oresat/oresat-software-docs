Github Actions
==============


What is Github Actions?
-----------------------
GitHub Actions is a tool provided by GitHub, the platform where you store and manage your code.
This tool helps you automate tasks related to your code, such as automatically testing it, checking its quality, and
even deploying it to a server. It's like having a helpful robot that can perform these tasks for you whenever
you make changes to your code.

By using GitHub Actions, you can:

1. **Save time**: Instead of doing repetitive tasks manually, like running tests or deploying your code, you can let
    GitHub Actions do it for you automatically.

2. **Improve code quality**: By automatically running tests and other checks on your code, you can catch errors and
    issues before they become bigger problems.

2. **Simplify collaboration**: When working with a team, GitHub Actions can help ensure that everyone's code meets
    the same standards by running the same checks and tests for each person's changes.

3. **Streamline deployments**: You can set up GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your code to a server or a
    cloud provider whenever you make changes, making the deployment process faster and smoother.

To use GitHub Actions, you create a workflow file in your repository, which is written in YAML, a simple and
human-readable language. This file tells GitHub Actions what tasks to perform and when to perform them, such as
when new code is pushed or a pull request is created.
