Connecting from a Linux host
============================

SSH (with shared internet)
--------------------------

.. note:: This guide only goes over Linux systems using `NetworkManager`_ or
   `systemd-networkd`_

- Connect the OreSat Linux card to host using a USB cable
- In a terminal run the following command and wait for the two connection from
  the OreSat Linux card to come up.

  .. code-block:: text

    $ watch -n 1 ip a
    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
      ...
    2: wlo1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
      ...
    3: enp0s20f0u3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 60:64:05:f9:0d:06 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    4: enp0s20f0u3i2: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state DOWN group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 60:64:05:f9:0d:08 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

- Make a note of the second connection name. If the is a ``enp*`` connection it
  is usually the ``enp*i2`` one (as show above) or if it is a ``enx*``
  connection it is the one with the higher number at the end of the name.

- **Only if the Linux host uses** `NetworkManager`_

  - Install ``dnsmasq`` on your system

  - In another terminal setup a DHCP server. **Replace** ``enp0s20f0u3i2`` in the follow
    command with the name found in previous step on your host.

    .. note:: This guide use the `nmcli` command as the NetworkManager applet is limited

    .. code-block:: text

      $ nmcli connection add type ethernet ifname enp0s20f0u3i2 ipv4.method shared con-name oresat-card

- **Only if the Linux host uses** `systemd-networkd`_

  - Setup the DHCP server. With your favorite IDE or text editor make the
    ``/etc/systemd/network/20-oresat-card.network`` file and add the following.
    **Replace** enp*i2 as needed.

      .. code-block:: text

        [Match]
        Name=enp*i2

        [Network]
        Address=10.42.1.1/24
        DHCPServer=true
        IPMasquerade=ipv4
        MulticastDNS=yes

        [DHCPServer]
        EmitDNS=yes
        DNS=9.9.9.9

  - Restart systemd-networkd

    .. code-block:: text

      $ sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd

- SSH using an IP address

    - Go back to the terminal with ``watch ip a`` command running at wait for the
      address to be set. Make a note of the address and IPv4 address space, it
      should be something like ``10.42.1.1/24``. 

      .. code-block:: text

        $ watch -n 1 ip a
        1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
          ...
        2: wlo1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
          ...
        3: enp0s20f0u3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 60:64:05:f9:0d:06 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        4: enp0s20f0u3i2: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state DOWN group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 60:64:05:f9:0d:08 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        inet 10.42.1.1/24 scope host lo
          valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        inet6 fe80::cbcb:674d:2adf/64 scope link noprefixroute
          valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

    - Install ``nmap`` for your system

    - Run nmap to figure out the card's IP address. **Replace** ``10.42.1.1/24`` in
      the follow command to be addres **with** the IPv4 address space found in the
      previous step.

      .. code-block:: text

        $ nmap -sn 10.42.1.1/24
        Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-04-13 22:07 UTC
        Nmap scan report for 10.42.1.1
        Host is up (0.00079s latency).
        Nmap scan report for 10.42.1.120
        Host is up (0.0035s latency).
        Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 2.63 seconds

    - That should print out two IP addresses (one is the Linux host and one is the
      OreSat card)

    - The terminal with ``watch ip a`` running is no longer needed.

    - SSH onto the card. Password is ``temppwd``. **Replace** ``10.42.1.120`` in
      the following command with other address that nmap found

      .. code-block:: text

        $ ssh debian@10.42.1.120

- SSH using mDNS domain

    
    - SSH onto the card. Password is ``temppwd``. **Replace** ``oresat-dev`` in
      the following command with other hostname
    
    .. code-block:: text

        $ ssh debian@oresat-dev.local

- Make sure shared internet is working

  .. code-block:: text

    $ ping www.google.com

Serial
------

- Install ``picocom`` for your distro

- Connect a USB to FTDI chip on the card debug board and to you system::

  $ picocom -b 115200 /dev/serial/by-id/usb-BeagleBoard*

- **Note:** To exit control-A-X
