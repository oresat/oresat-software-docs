Contributing
============

As a software developer for OreSat, you'll have the opportunity to contribute to various projects
and subsystems. To ensure a smooth and consistent development process, please adhere to the
following best practices:

#. **Communicate**: Keep your mentor and team members informed about your progress.
   Don't hesitate to ask for help or clarification when needed.

#. **Branching**: Always create a new branch for each task or feature you're working on. This keeps
   the main branch clean and makes it easier to manage and review changes.

#. **Commit frequently**: Make small, atomic commits with clear and concise commit messages. This
   makes it easier to track changes and identify potential issues.

#. **Code review**: Submit your changes as a pull request for review by your mentor or team members.
   Address any feedback and update your code as necessary.

#. **Testing**: Make sure to test your code thoroughly before submitting it for review. This helps
   catch any bugs or issues early in the development process.

Your contributions will play a crucial role in advancing Oregon's space exploration efforts and
shaping the future of open source CubeSats.
