# Vagrant Primer

You will be using a Vagrant box during your development cycle and s part of your onboarding, we would like to introduce
you to Vagrant, a powerful virtualization tool that plays a large role by having sharable, standardized development environments.
This section will provide you with an overview of Vagrant boxes and how they are used within our development environment.

Vagrant is an open-source tool that simplifies the process of setting up and managing virtual machines (VMs).
Vagrant boxes are pre-packaged VM templates that can be easily shared and customized. By using Vagrant boxes,
we can create consistent, reproducible development environments for our projects, making it easier for developers to
collaborate and contribute effectively.

### Getting Started with Vagrant Boxes

To begin working with Vagrant boxes in our tech stack, please follow the steps below:

1. Install Vagrant: Visit the Vagrant website (https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) and download the appropriate version
   for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

2. Install VirtualBox: Vagrant requires a virtualization provider like VirtualBox to manage VMs. Download and
   install the latest version of VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for your operating system.

3. Initialize and start the Vagrant box: Run the command `vagrant up` to initialize and start the VM.
   Vagrant will download the specified box, set up the VM, and provision it according to the configuration
   defined in the Vagrantfile.

4. Connect to the VM: Once the VM is up and running, use the command `vagrant ssh` to connect to it.
   You are now inside the VM and can start working on the project within the isolated development environment.

5. Stop and manage the VM: Use `vagrant halt` to stop the VM when you are done working.
   Other useful commands include `vagrant help`, `vagrant suspend`, `vagrant resume`, and `vagrant destroy`.
   Refer to the official Vagrant documentation (https://www.vagrantup.com/docs) for more information on managing your VM.

### Vagrant Best Practices

While working with Vagrant boxes in our tech stack, please keep the following best practices in mind:

1. **Use shared folders**: Configure shared folders between your host machine and the VM to easily transfer files and
   maintain a single source of truth for your project files. In this project, the important OreSat GitHub repositories are
   cloned and shared with the VM.

2. **Backup your work**: Although Vagrant boxes provide a consistent environment, it's still essential to regularly
   backup your work. Commit your changes to the Git repository and push them to the remote server.

3. **Stay in sync with your team**: Keep the Vagrantfile and any provisioning scripts up to date with the latest changes
   from your team. This ensures that your Vagrant box stays consistent with the project requirements.
